# Unattended Ubuntu ISO Maker

This simple script will create an unattended Ubuntu ISO from start to finish. It will ask you a few questions once, and embed your answers into a remastered ISO file for you to use over and over again.

This script creates a 100% original Ubuntu installation; the only additional software added is ```openssh-server```. There is no ```apt-get update``` performed. You have all the freedom in the world to customize your Ubuntu installation whichever way you see fit. This script just takes the pain out of re-installing Ubuntu over and over again.

## Compatibility

The script supports the following Ubuntu editions out of the box:

* Ubuntu 16.04.1 Server LTS i386  - Xenial Xerus
* Ubuntu 16.04.1 Server LTS amd64 - Xenial Xerus
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 Server LTS i386  - Trusty Tahr
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 Server LTS amd64 - Trusty Tahr

This script has been tested on and with these two versions as well, but I see no reason why it shouldn't work with other Ubuntu editions. Other editions would require minor changes to the script though.

## Usage

* From your command line, run the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hvanderlaan/ubuntu-unattended
$ sudo ./create-unattended-iso.sh
```
or

```

## What it does

This script does a bunch of stuff, here's the quick walk-through:

* It asks you for your preferences regarding the unattended ISO
* Downloads the appropriate Ubuntu original ISO straight from the Ubuntu servers; if a file with the exact name exists, it will use that instead (so it won't download it more than once if you are creating several unattended ISO's with different defaults)
* Downloads the netson preseed file; this file contains all the magic answers to auto-install ubuntu. It uses the following defaults for you (only showing most important, for details, simply check the seed file in this repository):
 * Language/locale: en_US
 * Keyboard layout: US International
 * Root login disabled (so make sure you write down your default usernames' password!)
 * Partitioning: LVM, full disk, single partition
* Install the mkpasswd program (part of the whois package) to generate a hashed version of your password
* Install the genisoimage program to generate the new ISO file
* Mount the downloaded ISO image to a temporary folder
* Copy the contents of the original ISO to a working directory
* Set the default installer language
* Add/update the preseed file
* Add the autoinstall option to the installation menu
* Generate the new ISO file
* Cleanup
* Show a summary of what happended:
